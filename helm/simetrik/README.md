This configuration:

Cost Optimization Features:

Prioritizes Spot instances with on-demand fallback

Uses instance types with good Spot availability

Enables node consolidation for better resource utilization

Implements proper interruption handling

Uses smaller instance sizes for better bin packing

Reliability Features:

Spreads pods across availability zones

Uses pod anti-affinity for better distribution

Implements graceful termination

Sets up proper PodDisruptionBudgets

Configures faster health checks

Best Practices:

Uses Nitro-based instances

Excludes less efficient instance families

Implements proper node refresh (30 days)

Uses gp3 volumes for better performance/cost

Configures proper resource requests/limits

High Availability:

Multi-AZ deployment

Pod topology spread

Minimum availability guarantees

Graceful pod termination

Quick pod replacement on interruption

Remember to:

Test the application's resilience to Spot interruptions

Monitor pod disruptions and availability

Adjust resource requests based on actual usage

Consider using KEDA for event-driven scaling if needed

Monitor cost savings and adjust instance types as needed
